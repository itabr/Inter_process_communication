project 1b

included:
	Makefile
	README
	client.c
	server.c
	my.key

Example:
	./server --port 2001
	./client --port 2001

	./server --port 2001 --encryp
	./client --port 2001 --encryp

	./server --port 2001 --encryp
	./client --port 2001 --encryp --log [filename]

filename = uses specific file to write the log into
Important note:
in this lab i made multi-process telnet-like client and server.
this program uses mcrypt(3), socket(7) functions of c.
the important part about this lab is first sockets, how they work and impelemented.
sockets need many variable to be created, such as port,AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM.
the tutorial about sockets can be found on :   http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/socket.html
the other function that was used was mcrypt. mcrypt does not exist on mac and has to be either downloaded or
just use a linux server. mcrypt has two part of encrypt and decrypt.
encrypt uses the key to encrypt the buffer in the server and in client we decrypt the buffer so it is human
readable. Makefile make usase the -g option inorder to beable to run the program on gdb. the serverfile
create the server and client file will execute the shell and use fork and use socket to connect to the server.

options for Makefile are :
	all: creates executable for both server and client with -pthread and -lmcrypt flags
	server: creates the only server executable
	client: Creates the only client executable
	clean: Deletes all the files created in by the Makefile including the executables.
	dist: creates a tarball containing 5 files - server.c, client.c, Makefile, README and my.key.
